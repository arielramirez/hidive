## Implementation Notes
- There were Â’ characters in the JSON data substituting the apostrophes. I manually converted them to apostrophes.
- I realized that modals were using bootstrap after implementing them from scratch in react. I choose not to re-implement them in the interest of time. All features hidive.com features were retained except for the transition effects.
- This was my first time working with Docker. A decent amount of time was spent figuring it out and setting up the server.
- I have limited experience with CSS transitions and they were a pain point here. I implemented a few, but did not have time to finish all of them.

#### Data Not Available
  - Badges on content sliders
  - Icons next to content slider titles
  - Image rotation on hover in content slider
  - Content slider dropdown sub-navigation and Episode List/You Might Like tabs
  - Content Slider View All links for sliders with more than 15 slides

#### Missing Bells and Whistles (out of time)
- Search icon in search area is a down-chevron instead of search icon
- Search bar requires extra click to focus on the typing area - it should auto-focus after expanded
- Search bar does not have collapse animation
- Register Modal width is too wide
- Video Slider Dropdown animation on expand, collapse and switching shows
- Modal animations on open/close

#### Next steps if asked to continue. . .

  - Reorganize styling, get rid of redundancies between custom.css and hidive.css
    - TECHDEBT: remove the nasty note in VideoSlide regarding the class name GREEN - just change the nonsense class name to something sensical
